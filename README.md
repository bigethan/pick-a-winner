# pick-a-winner

A CLI tool to choose, excitingly, between listed options! It is not fast, but it is fun!

## Install 
```
npm install -g pick-a-winner
```

## Usage:
```
pick-a-winner option1 option2 option3 option4 "option five" option6...
```

## Special Option
If you specify an option `nobody` the app will treat that as a "nobody wins" option and play the appropriate sounds.
